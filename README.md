# linear-regression-test
Simple linear regression implementation to test out what I have learned from Andrew Ng's course.
Using the sci-kit learn library, I managed to train a moderately accurate linear regression model based on the test dataset (89% accuracy).
That is pretty much it :) , enjoy reading a beginner aspiring AI engineer's clumsy code!
